Theme Scifi_K for XOOPS

Package contains:

-2block templates for system "module"
-1font used in all graphic text
-3PSD files 
-1 Read me file :)

2 system blocks were a bit modified because they were not displaying correctly in IE (theme block and site info block)

Font is included for editing the header and buttons

PSD files are as follows:

-1 PSD of the entire layout containing all ellements;
-1 PSD of the header for easier editing fornot so advanced users
-1 PSD of the footer for the same reason as above

ALL PSD files are already sliced so it should be pretty easy to work them

Footer PSD has the effect of mouse-over in theme, header PSD has the effect of mouse out in the theme...it was done like that
so one ca see the difference and coppy one layer atributes to the other as they share the same effects.

Theme is a static 994px theme with 3 columns...i wuld recomend however using just two of them so you won't have the ellememts 
crowded in a small space.

Theme is FREE to use as you please as long as you DON'T sell or make it available to download conditioned by registration.

Theme is compliant XHTML 1.0, CSS 3
